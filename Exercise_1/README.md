# Exercise 1

In this exercise an image is processed based on:
1. Point transformation, using given functions or threshold.
2. Histogram transformation, using given distributions (uniform and gaussian).

3. Finally, as a third part, use these two transforms so that the histogram of the image approximates a given distributions.
